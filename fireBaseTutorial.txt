- include js firebase library: <script src='https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.2.1/firebase.js'></script>
- instantiate a firebase reference: var myDataRef = new Firebase('https://i63lnqioor6.firebaseio-demo.com/');
- insert text into DB: myDataRef.set('User ' + name + ' says ' + text);
- insert objects: myDataRef.set({name: name, text: text});
<!--
You've already learned how to write data to specific, named locations in Firebase, 
but your chat application will require a list of messages. 
Firebase provides a helper function called push() that makes creating lists easy.
Modify your code below to use push() instead of set() so that your chat can 
support a list of messages (rather than just one):
-->
- Update?: myDataRef.push({name: name, text: text});
<!--
Firebase lists use chronologically-ordered, globally-unique IDs as the keys for items. 
This means that many clients can add to the same list without conflict.
-->

- reading data: https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/retrieving-data.html
adds a callback to the db instance so that when we insert data gets called
myDataRef.on('child_added', function(snapshot) {
    //We'll fill this in later.
    var message = snapshot.val();
    displayChatMessage(message.name, message.text);
});
